<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>This is the version history for the 
<a href="http://semanchuk.com/philip/posix_ipc/">posix_ipc
module</a>.</p>

<ul id="history">

    <li><strong><span id="current">Current</span> &ndash; 0.9.0 (31 Dec 2010) &ndash;</strong>
        <p>Added the <tt>demo3</tt> directory with demos of message queue 
            notification techniques. Also, fixed two bugs related to message 
            queue notification. Big thanks to
            Philip D. Bober for debugging and providing a patch to the
            most difficult part of the code. The bugs were &ndash;
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First, the series of calls to set up the Python thread in 
               <tt>process_notification()</tt> were simply wrong. They worked 
               some (most?) of the time but would segfault eventually because 
               I was creating a Python thread state when I should not have.
            </li>
            
            <li>Second, the code in <tt>process_notification()</tt> failed
                to consider that the user's callback might re-request 
                notification, thus overwriting pointers that I would later
                decref. <tt>process_notification()</tt> is now thread-safe.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
            

    <li>0.8.1 (15 Mar 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a sloppy declaration that caused a compile error under
            Cygwin 1.7.1. Thanks to Jill McCutcheon for the bug report.
        </p>
    </li>
            

    <li>0.8.0 (2 Mar 2010) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed message queue support detection in FreeBSD and
                the platform-specific documentation about FreeBSD.
            </li>
            
            <li>Rearranged the documentation and split the history 
                (which you're reading now) into a separate file.
            </li>
            
            <li>I fixed two small bugs related to the confusing 
                message queue constants. The bugs and associated changes are 
                explained below. The explanation is really long not 
                because the changes were big (they weren't), but because
                they and rationale behind them are subtle.
            
                <p>Fixing these bugs was made easier by this realization &ndash;
                    on all of the systems to which I have access that implement 
                    message queues (FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, Linux, and Windows + 
                    Cygwin), all except Linux implement them as 
                    memory-mapped files or something similar. On these
                    non-Linux systems, the
                    maximum queue message count and size are pretty darn big 
                    (<tt>LONG_MAX</tt>). Therefore, only on Linux is anyone likely to 
                    encounter limits to message queue size and content.
                </p>
        
                <p>The first bug I fixed was related to four message queue
                    constants mentioned in <tt>posix_ipc</tt> documentation:
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</tt>, 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt>, 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</tt> and 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt>. All four were defined
                     in the <tt>C</tt>
                    code, but the two <tt>XXX_DEFAULT</tt> constants weren't exposed on 
                    the Python side. 
                </p>
    
                <p>The second bug was that under Linux, <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</tt> and 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</tt> were permanently fixed to their 
                    values at <tt>posix_ipc</tt>'s compile/install time even if the 
                    relevant system values changed later. Thanks to Kyle Tippetts 
                    for bringing this to my attention. 
                </p>
    
                <p><tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> was arbitrarily limited to 
                    (at most) 1024. This wasn't a bug, just a bad choice.
                </p>
        
                <p>I made a few changes in order to fix these problems &ndash;</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The constants <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</tt> and 
                        <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</tt>
                        <strong>have been deleted</strong> since they were only sure to 
                        be accurate on systems where they were irrelevant. Furthermore, 
                        Linux (the only place where they matter) exposes these values 
                        through the file system (in 
                        <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</tt> and 
                        <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</tt> respectively) so Python
                        apps that need them can read them without any help 
                        from <tt>posix_ipc</tt>.
                    </li>

                    <li><tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> and 
                        <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> are now exposed to 
                        Python as they should have been all along. 
                        <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> is now set to 
                        <tt>LONG_MAX</tt> on all platforms except Linux, where
                        it's set at compile time from <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</tt>. 
                    </li>
                    <li><tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> remains at the fairly 
                        arbitrary value of 8k. It's not a good idea to make it too big
                        since a buffer of this size is allocated every time 
                        <tt>MessageQueue.receive()</tt> is called. Under Linux, I 
                        check the contents of <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</tt>
                        and make <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> smaller if 
                        necessary.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.7.0 (21 Feb 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Added Python 3.1 support.</p>
    </li>
            
    <li>0.6.3 (15 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where creating an IPC object with invalid
                parameters would correctly raise a <tt>ValueError</tt>, but 
                with a message that may or may not have correctly identified
                the cause. (My code was making an educated guess that was
                sometimes wrong.)
                
                <p>As of this version, if initialization of an IPC object 
                    fails with the error code <tt>EINVAL</tt>, 
                    <tt>posix_ipc</tt> raises a <tt>ValueError</tt>
                    with the vague-but-correct message "Invalid parameter(s)".
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Cleaned up the code a little internally.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
            
    <li>0.6.2 (30 Dec 2009) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a bug where a <tt>MessageQueue</tt>'s <tt>mode</tt>
            attribute returned garbage. Grazie to Stefano Debenedetti for
            the bug report.
        </p>
    </li>
            
    <li>0.6.1 (29 Nov 2009) &ndash;
        <p>There were no functional changes to the module in this version, but 
        I added the convenience function <tt>close_fd()</tt> and fixed 
        some docmentation and demo bugs/sloppiness.
        </p>
    	<ul>
            <li>Added the convenience function <tt>SharedMemory.close_fd()</tt>.
                Thanks to Kyle Tippetts for pointing out the usefulness
                of this.
            </li>
            <li>Added the module attributes <tt>__version__</tt>, 
                <tt>__copyright__</tt>, <tt>__author__</tt> and 
                <tt>__license__</tt>.
            </li>
    	    <li>Fixed the license info embedded in <tt>posix_ipc_module.c</tt>
    	        which was still referring to GPL.
            <li>Replaced <tt>file()</tt> in <tt>setup.py</tt> with 
                <tt>open()</tt>/<tt>close()</tt>.</li>

            <li>Demo changes &ndash;
                <ul>
                    <li>Made the demo a bit faster, especially for large
                        shared memory chunks. Thanks to Andrew Trevorrow
                        for the suggestion and patch.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug in premise.c; it wasn't closing the semaphore.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug in premise.py; it wasn't closing the 
                        shared memory's file descriptor. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed bugs in conclusion.py; it wasn't closing the 
                        shared memory's file descriptor, the semaphore or 
                        the mapfile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.6 (5 Oct 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Relicensed from the GPL to a BSD license to celebrate the
    	        one year anniversary of this module.
            <li>Updated Cygwin info.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.5 (17 Sept 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Set <tt>MQ_MAX_MESSAGES</tt> and <tt>MQ_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE</tt> to 
    	        <tt>LONG_MAX</tt> under cygwin.
    	        (Danke to René Liebscher.)
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Surrounded the <tt>#define PAGE_SIZE</tt> in probe_results.h with 
    	        <tt>#ifndef/#endif</tt> because it is already defined on some systems.
    	        (Danke to René Liebscher, again.)
    	    </li>
            <li>Minor documentation changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.4 (21 Jun 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added SignalError.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug where 
    	        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/ada39e984dfc3da6/fd6becbdce91a6be?#fd6becbdce91a6be">Python 
    	        would generate an uncatchable
    	        KeyboardInterrupt when Ctrl-C was hit during a wait</a>
    	        (e.g. <tt>sem.acquire()</tt>).

    	        <p>Thanks to Maciek W. for reporting the problem and to 
    	            Piet van Oostrum and Greg for help with a solution.
    	        </p>
            </li>
            <li>Minor documentation changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.3 (8 Mar 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added automatic generation of names.</li>
    	    <li>Changed status to beta.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.2 (12 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed a memory leak in <tt>MessageQueue.receive()</tt>.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug where the name of the <tt>MessageQueue</tt> 
    	        <tt>current_messages</tt> attribute didn't match the name
    	        given in the documentation.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added the VERSION attribute to the module.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed a documentation bug that said message queue 
    	        notifications were not yet supported.
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.1 (8 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed outdated info in setup.py that was showing up 
    	        in the Python package index. Updated README while I
    	        was at it.
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5 (8 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added the message queue notification feature.</li>
    	    <li>Added a <tt>mode</tt> attribute to each type.</li>
    	    <li>Added <tt>str()</tt> and <tt>repr()</tt> support to 
    	        each object.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added a demo for message queues.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed some minor documentation problems and added
    	        some information (esp. about Windows + Cygwin).
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.4 (9 Jan 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added message queue support.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed the poor choices I'd made for names for classes and
    	        errors by removing the leading "Posix" and "PosixIpc". 
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Simplified the prober and expanded it (for message
    	        queue support).
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Cleaned up this documentation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.3.2 (4 Jan 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed an uninitialized value passed to PyMem_Free() when
    	        invalid params were passed to either constructor. 
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.3.1 (1 Jan 2009) &ndash;
     	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed a big bug where the custom exceptions defined by this
    	        module weren't visible.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Fixed a compile complaint about the redefinition of 
    	        <tt>SEM_VALUE_MAX</tt> on Linux (Ubuntu) that I introduced
    	        in the previous version.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug in the demo program premise.c where I wasn't
    	        closing the file descriptor associated with the shared
    	        memory.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added the <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt> attribute. This was already
    	        available in the mmap module that you need to use shared
    	        memory anyway, but adding it makes the interface more 
    	        consistent with the <tt>sysv_ipc</tt> module.
    	    </li>
    	</ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.3 (19 Dec 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Added informative custom errors instead of raising 
        	    OSError when something goes wrong.
        	</li>

        	<li>Made the code friendly to multi-threaded applications.
        	</li>

			<li>Added the constants <tt>O_CREX</tt> and 
			    <tt>SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX</tt>.
			</li>

			<li>Added code to prohibit negative timeout values.</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>0.2 (4 Dec 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Removed the un-Pythonic <tt>try_acquire()</tt> method. The
        	    same functionality is now available by passing a timeout of 
        	    <tt>0</tt> to the <tt>.acquire()</tt> method.
        	</li>

			<li>Renamed the module constant <tt>ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</tt> to
			    <tt>SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</tt>.
			</li>

			<li>Moved the demo code into its own directory and added C
			    versions of the Python scripts. The parameters are now in a 
			    text file shared by the Python and C program, so you can
			    run the C version of Mrs. Premise and have it communicate with
			    the Python version of Mrs. Conclusion and vice versa.
			</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>0.1 (9 Oct 2008) &ndash; Original (alpha) version.</li>
