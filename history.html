<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>This is the version history for the 
<a href="http://semanchuk.com/philip/posix_ipc/">posix_ipc
module</a>.</p>

<ul id="history">
    <li><strong><span id="current">Current</span> &ndash; 0.9.8 (20 Feb 2014) &ndash;</strong>
    	<p>As with 0.9.7, there are no code or feature changes in this version.
    	This version merely corrects a documentation error. 
    	</p>

    	<p>This version comes with a big wish for peace in Ukraine. Мир!</p>
	</li>

    <li>0.9.7 (20 Feb 2014) &ndash;
    	<p>There are no code or feature changes in this version. The bump in
    	    version number reflects that this is the first version
    	    also available on PyPI.
    	</p>

    	<p>This version comes with a big wish for peace in Ukraine. Мир!</p>
	</li>

    <li>0.9.6 (23 Oct 2013) &ndash;

    	<p>Fixed two BSD-specific bugs introduced in version 0.9.5 
    		that occurred if the kernel module <tt>mqueuefs</tt> wasn't 
    		loaded at install time. Specifically -- 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The installer 
            would print a harmless but distracting error message from sysctl.
            (This also affected OS X which is FreeBSD-ish.)
            </li>
            
            <li><tt>posix_ipc</tt> would build with an inappropriate 
            value for <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt>. 
            Subsequent attempts to create a message queue would fail unless the
            caller set the <tt>max_messages</tt> param to an appropriate
            value. (This didn't affect OS X since OS X doesn't support message
            queues at all.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, rewrote the message queue thread notification code to address
        the old bug (<tt>Fatal Python error: PyEval_AcquireLock: current thread state is NULL</tt>)
        that appeared during release testing for 0.9.5 and which 
        has plagued me on and off since I wrote this code. The new code uses 
        <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/init.html#non-python-created-threads">the
        algorithm recommended in the Python documentation</a> which may have
        been flaky when I started using it in Python 2.4. It seems stable now
        under Python 2.6+/3. 
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.5 (14 Oct 2013) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Added the ability to use Semaphores in context managers.
        	Thanks to Matt Ruffalo for the suggestion and patch.
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a big under FreeBSD 9.x where I used overly ambitious
            values for some message queue constants at build time. Now,
            <tt>posix_ipc</tt> asks <tt>sysctl</tt> for the correct values.
            <i>Köszönöm</i> to Attila Nagy for the bug report.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.4 (2 Sept 2012) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a buglet. When creating shared memory under Linux and 
        specifying both a size and the read-only flag, creating the memory
        would succeed but calling <tt>ftruncate()</tt> would fail. 
        The failure to change the size was correctly reported 
        but <tt>posix_ipc</tt> failed to clean up the shared memory segment 
        it had created. That's now fixed. Thanks to Kevin Miles for the bug
        report.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.3 (2 Jan 2012) &ndash;
        <p>Added a bugfix/feature to raise an error (rather than segault) 
            when trying to use a closed semaphore.
            Thanks to Russel for the suggestion and patch.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.2 (6 Nov 2011) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where timeouts in <tt>Semaphore.acquire()</tt>, 
                <tt>MessageQueue.send()</tt> and <tt>MessageQueue.receive()</tt>
                were only accurate to about one second due to use of the C call
                <tt>time()</tt>. Switching to <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> fixes 
                the problem. Thanks to Douglas Young for the bug report and
                patch.
            </li>
        
            <li>Fixed a bug in <tt>prober.py</tt> that caused install to fail
                under Ubuntu 11.10. <tt>prober.py</tt> specified link options 
                in the wrong order, and so linking one of the test 
                applications that's built during setup was failing. Thanks
                to Kevin Miles for the bug report.
            </li>

            <li>Added a check in <tt>prober.py</tt> to see if 
                <tt>sysconf_names</tt> exists in the <tt>os</tt> module. It
                doesn't exist under Cygwin, and this code caused an error 
                on that platform. Thanks to Rizwan Raza for the bug report.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.9.1 (7 Apr 2011) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed (?) a bug in message queue thread notification that caused
                <tt>ceval: tstate mix-up</tt> and other fun messages. Thanks to
                Lev Maximov for the bug report.
            </li>
        
            <li>Added the <tt>demo3</tt> directory with demos of message queue.
                This was supposed be included in version 0.9.0 but I accidentally
                left it out. (Also reported by Lev.) 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.9.0 (31 Dec 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Added the <tt>demo3</tt> directory with demos of message queue 
            notification techniques. Also, fixed two bugs related to message 
            queue notification. Big thanks to
            Philip D. Bober for debugging and providing a patch to the
            most difficult part of the code. The bugs were &ndash;
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First, the series of calls to set up the Python thread in 
               <tt>process_notification()</tt> were simply wrong. They worked 
               some (most?) of the time but would segfault eventually because 
               I was creating a Python thread state when I should not have.
            </li>
            
            <li>Second, the code in <tt>process_notification()</tt> failed
                to consider that the user's callback might re-request 
                notification, thus overwriting pointers that I would later
                decref. <tt>process_notification()</tt> is now thread-safe.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
            

    <li>0.8.1 (15 Mar 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a sloppy declaration that caused a compile error under
            Cygwin 1.7.1. Thanks to Jill McCutcheon for the bug report.
        </p>
    </li>
            

    <li>0.8.0 (2 Mar 2010) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed message queue support detection in FreeBSD and
                the platform-specific documentation about FreeBSD.
            </li>
            
            <li>Rearranged the documentation and split the history 
                (which you're reading now) into a separate file.
            </li>
            
            <li>I fixed two small bugs related to the confusing 
                message queue constants. The bugs and associated changes are 
                explained below. The explanation is really long not 
                because the changes were big (they weren't), but because
                they and rationale behind them are subtle.
            
                <p>Fixing these bugs was made easier by this realization: 
                    on all of the systems to which I have access that implement 
                    message queues (FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, Linux, and Windows + 
                    Cygwin), all except Linux implement them as 
                    memory-mapped files or something similar. On these
                    non-Linux systems, the
                    maximum queue message count and size are pretty darn big 
                    (<tt>LONG_MAX</tt>). Therefore, only on Linux is anyone likely to 
                    encounter limits to message queue size and content.
                </p>
        
                <p>The first bug I fixed was related to four message queue
                    constants mentioned in <tt>posix_ipc</tt> documentation:
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</tt>, 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt>, 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</tt> and 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt>. All four were defined
                     in the <tt>C</tt>
                    code, but the two <tt>XXX_DEFAULT</tt> constants weren't exposed on 
                    the Python side. 
                </p>
    
                <p>The second bug was that under Linux, <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</tt> and 
                    <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</tt> were permanently fixed to their 
                    values at <tt>posix_ipc</tt>'s compile/install time even if the 
                    relevant system values changed later. Thanks to Kyle Tippetts 
                    for bringing this to my attention. 
                </p>
    
                <p><tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> was arbitrarily limited to 
                    (at most) 1024. This wasn't a bug, just a bad choice.
                </p>
        
                <p>I made a few changes in order to fix these problems &ndash;</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The constants <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</tt> and 
                        <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</tt>
                        <strong>have been deleted</strong> since they were only sure to 
                        be accurate on systems where they were irrelevant. Furthermore, 
                        Linux (the only place where they matter) exposes these values 
                        through the file system (in 
                        <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</tt> and 
                        <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</tt> respectively) so Python
                        apps that need them can read them without any help 
                        from <tt>posix_ipc</tt>.
                    </li>

                    <li><tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> and 
                        <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> are now exposed to 
                        Python as they should have been all along. 
                        <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> is now set to 
                        <tt>LONG_MAX</tt> on all platforms except Linux, where
                        it's set at compile time from <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</tt>. 
                    </li>
                    <li><tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> remains at the fairly 
                        arbitrary value of 8k. It's not a good idea to make it too big
                        since a buffer of this size is allocated every time 
                        <tt>MessageQueue.receive()</tt> is called. Under Linux, I 
                        check the contents of <tt>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</tt>
                        and make <tt>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</tt> smaller if 
                        necessary.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.7.0 (21 Feb 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Added Python 3.1 support.</p>
    </li>
            
    <li>0.6.3 (15 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where creating an IPC object with invalid
                parameters would correctly raise a <tt>ValueError</tt>, but 
                with a message that may or may not have correctly identified
                the cause. (My code was making an educated guess that was
                sometimes wrong.)
                
                <p>As of this version, if initialization of an IPC object 
                    fails with the error code <tt>EINVAL</tt>, 
                    <tt>posix_ipc</tt> raises a <tt>ValueError</tt>
                    with the vague-but-correct message "Invalid parameter(s)".
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Cleaned up the code a little internally.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
            
    <li>0.6.2 (30 Dec 2009) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a bug where a <tt>MessageQueue</tt>'s <tt>mode</tt>
            attribute returned garbage. <i>Grazie</i> to Stefano Debenedetti for
            the bug report.
        </p>
    </li>
            
    <li>0.6.1 (29 Nov 2009) &ndash;
        <p>There were no functional changes to the module in this version, but 
        I added the convenience function <tt>close_fd()</tt> and fixed 
        some docmentation and demo bugs/sloppiness.
        </p>
    	<ul>
            <li>Added the convenience function <tt>SharedMemory.close_fd()</tt>.
                Thanks to Kyle Tippetts for pointing out the usefulness
                of this.
            </li>
            <li>Added the module attributes <tt>__version__</tt>, 
                <tt>__copyright__</tt>, <tt>__author__</tt> and 
                <tt>__license__</tt>.
            </li>
    	    <li>Fixed the license info embedded in <tt>posix_ipc_module.c</tt>
    	        which was still referring to GPL.
            <li>Replaced <tt>file()</tt> in <tt>setup.py</tt> with 
                <tt>open()</tt>/<tt>close()</tt>.</li>

            <li>Demo changes &ndash;
                <ul>
                    <li>Made the demo a bit faster, especially for large
                        shared memory chunks. Thanks to Andrew Trevorrow
                        for the suggestion and patch.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug in premise.c; it wasn't closing the semaphore.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug in premise.py; it wasn't closing the 
                        shared memory's file descriptor. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed bugs in conclusion.py; it wasn't closing the 
                        shared memory's file descriptor, the semaphore or 
                        the mapfile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.6 (5 Oct 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Relicensed from the GPL to a BSD license to celebrate the
    	        one year anniversary of this module.
            <li>Updated Cygwin info.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.5 (17 Sept 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Set <tt>MQ_MAX_MESSAGES</tt> and <tt>MQ_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE</tt> to 
    	        <tt>LONG_MAX</tt> under cygwin.
    	        (<i>Danke</i> to René Liebscher.)
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Surrounded the <tt>#define PAGE_SIZE</tt> in probe_results.h with 
    	        <tt>#ifndef/#endif</tt> because it is already defined on some systems.
    	        (<i>Danke</i> to René Liebscher, again.)
    	    </li>
            <li>Minor documentation changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.4 (21 Jun 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added SignalError.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug where 
    	        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/ada39e984dfc3da6/fd6becbdce91a6be?#fd6becbdce91a6be">Python 
    	        would generate an uncatchable
    	        KeyboardInterrupt when Ctrl-C was hit during a wait</a>
    	        (e.g. <tt>sem.acquire()</tt>).

    	        <p>Thanks to Maciek W. for reporting the problem and to 
    	            Piet van Oostrum and Greg for help with a solution.
    	        </p>
            </li>
            <li>Minor documentation changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5.3 (8 Mar 2009) &ndash;

    	    <li>Fixed a bug where the name of the <tt>MessageQueue</tt>

    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed outdated info in setup.py that was showing up 
    	        in the Python package index. Updated README while I
    	        was at it.
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.5 (8 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added the message queue notification feature.</li>
    	    <li>Added a <tt>mode</tt> attribute to each type.</li>
    	    <li>Added <tt>str()</tt> and <tt>repr()</tt> support to

        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.4 (9 Jan 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added message queue support.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed the poor choices I'd made for names for classes and
    	        errors by removing the leading "Posix" and "PosixIpc". 
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Simplified the prober and expanded it (for message
    	        queue support).
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Cleaned up this documentation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.3.2 (4 Jan 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed an uninitialized value passed to PyMem_Free() when
    	        invalid params were passed to either constructor. 
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
        
    <li>0.3.1 (1 Jan 2009) &ndash;
     	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed a big bug where the custom exceptions defined by this
    	        module weren't visible.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Fixed a compile complaint about the redefinition of 
    	        <tt>SEM_VALUE_MAX</tt> on Linux (Ubuntu) that I introduced
    	        in the previous version.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug in the demo program premise.c where I wasn't
    	        closing the file descriptor associated with the shared
    	        memory.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added the <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt> attribute. This was already
    	        available in the mmap module that you need to use shared
    	        memory anyway, but adding it makes the interface more 
    	        consistent with the <tt>sysv_ipc</tt> module.
    	    </li>
    	</ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.3 (19 Dec 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Added informative custom errors instead of raising 
        	    OSError when something goes wrong.
        	</li>

        	<li>Made the code friendly to multi-threaded applications.
        	</li>

			<li>Added the constants <tt>O_CREX</tt> and 
			    <tt>SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX</tt>.
			</li>

			<li>Added code to prohibit negative timeout values.</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>0.2 (4 Dec 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Removed the un-Pythonic <tt>try_acquire()</tt> method. The
        	    same functionality is now available by passing a timeout of 
        	    <tt>0</tt> to the <tt>.acquire()</tt> method.
        	</li>

			<li>Renamed the module constant <tt>ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</tt> to
			    <tt>SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</tt>.
			</li>

			<li>Moved the demo code into its own directory and added C
			    versions of the Python scripts. The parameters are now in a 
			    text file shared by the Python and C program, so you can
			    run the C version of Mrs. Premise and have it communicate with
			    the Python version of Mrs. Conclusion and vice versa.
			</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>0.1 (9 Oct 2008) &ndash; Original (alpha) version.</li>
</ul>
