POSIX IPC

- Fix Russel's bug. Best choice is probably to check for a NULL pointer in Semaphore & Msg Queue code (not needed in shared mem?) AND add a line to the doc suggesting that people set their variable = to the return from sem.close() or sem.unlink().


-- next todo 
- why not use "z" as the arg formatter for object names passed by the caller? Would obviate the need for convert_name_param()

- check to see if the fancy code for handling interrupts (Ctrl+C) still works under Python 3.x. Answer -- looks OK from preliminary test

- The standard library's os module accepts bytes & bytearrays for filenames. This code probably should too. You might be able to do it for (almost) free. Read the code for PyUnicode_FSConverter() to see what it does if it is fed a bytes object.


- consider adding to freshmeat

- consider this:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Python

- can I use select.select() on a message queue handle?
- update PyPi (python setup.py register)
