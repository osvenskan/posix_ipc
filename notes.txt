POSIX IPC

-- next done 
- added Python 2 & 3 to classifiers in setup.py for PyPi. 
- Fixed FreeBSD support; now works w/v8.0 (and possibly earlier). 
- Fixed a bug that prevented recognition of message queue support under FreeBSD. 
-  break history into a separate page

-- next todo 

- MQ_PRIO_MAX is #defined in limits.h  -- check on FReeBSD


Put this off until second 3.x release

- check to see if the fancy code for handling interrupts (Ctrl+C) still works under Python 3.x. Answer -- looks OK from preliminary test

- The standard library's os module accepts bytes & bytearrays for filenames. This code probably should too. You might be able to do it for (almost) free. Read the code for PyUnicode_FSConverter() to see what it does if it is fed a bytes object.


- consider adding to freshmeat

- consider adding "provides" to setup.py (file:///usr/local/doc/Python-Docs-2.5/dist/node10.html)
- consider this:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Python

- add demo of signal & thread
- can I use select.select() on a message queue handle?
- unnamed semaphores
- update PyPi (python setup.py register)




- Does posix_listdir() in posixmodule.c leak a bytes object? It calls PyUnicode_FSConverter() on opath but doesn't call releasebytes().
