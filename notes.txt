POSIX IPC

= Release Instructions =

1) Create the tarball and upload to PyPI. This has to be done all in one step.
   python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar upload

You can upload to the test PyPI with this command â€” 
   python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi

2) Run ./post_dist.py to shuffle files and create the RSS info.

3) update semanchuk.com with new binaries, rss.xml, HTML.

-- next todo 
- why not use "z" as the arg formatter for object names passed by the caller? Would obviate the need for convert_name_param()

- check to see if the fancy code for handling interrupts (Ctrl+C) still works under Python 3.x. Answer -- looks OK from preliminary test

- The standard library's os module accepts bytes & bytearrays for filenames. This code probably should too. You might be able to do it for (almost) free. Read the code for PyUnicode_FSConverter() to see what it does if it is fed a bytes object.


- can I use select.select() on a message queue handle?
- update PyPi (python setup.py register)
